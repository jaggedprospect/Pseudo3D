# Pseudo3D
This is a small program that simulates a 3D environment using 2D images. In other words, it creates the illusion of a 3D ennvironment by utilizing a rendering technique known as RAYCASTING (this is how games such as DOOM were created). Raycasting requires far less computational power than traditional 3D engines, so it is an especially useful technique for weaker computers.

The majority of this program is based on a guide provided by <b>sheeptheelectric<b> at https://www.instructables.com/Making-a-Basic-3D-Engine-in-Java/.

I initially intended to flesh this out into a complete shooter game about 2 years ago, but this was a bit beyond my skill level at the time. If my schedule permits, I will be working on this again in the near future. Now that I have gained more experience in game development and Java programming, I am confident that it can be finished!

If you would like to download and test this program for yourself, I will be updating this README to include <b>Instructions<b> and <b>Use<b> sections.

In the meantime, feel free to download the source code and res files for yourself!
